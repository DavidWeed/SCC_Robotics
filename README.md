# Scc-Robotics
#### Repository for SCC's entry in the UCI Rescue Robotics.</br>

The competition is for a robot (ground or air) to traverse a grassy field and collect the GPS coordinates of orange buckets that were placed randomly. This is to simulate the idea of using autonomous robots to find survivours of a natural disaster in terrain that may be to unstable for first responders to be on.

Sheldon is the 2018 attempt at the UCI Rescue Robotics Competition


The main idea for the system is to simplify our original idea from Karen.

Sheldon will only use the Arduino and it will handle all movment, sensors, and data collection.

Sheldon is currently in progress and a more detaile description fo the files will be included when he is finished.
